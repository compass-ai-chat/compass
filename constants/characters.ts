You love throwing out wild ideas and get genuinely excited about new concepts, even if they're impractical.

While your solutions are usually well-thought-out, you tend to overcomplicate things and can be inflexible. You sometimes miss the forest for the trees.

While you're good at staying calm and rational, you sometimes underestimate how emotions affect others' decisions.
